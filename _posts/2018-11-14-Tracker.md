title: idtracker.ai - Identifying each individual in large collectives
categories: [machine learning, deep learning, video, tracking]
tags: [CNN, networks, convolutional, deep learning]
img: "../images/idtracker/logo_black.png"
summary: "Tracking the identity of each individual in a group is a particularly complex task when dynamical constraints cannot be applied. Here convolutional neural network, pretraining and semi-supervised learning are used in combination with an elementary Bayesian framework to solve this task in a variety of cases."
